Install steps for:
<h1>pyenv (python and pip)<br>nvm (node and npm)<br>conda and docker notes</h1>

To open local .ipynb files, run `jupyter notebook` after choosing "New Terminal at Folder".

## JAM and Yarn

We generally focus on [JAM Stack](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/what-is-jamstack/) development without builds.
When we do build, we'll do so with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) if the project isn't already using npm.
Yarn syntax is easier and the builds are faster. 

## Use a GitHub token to push files

[Github token steps](../../../localsite/start/steps/github-token) - Push files from python or Rust.

## Start a Virtual Environment 

See the [pyenv](#pyenv) steps below if you need to run a different version of python.

Always using a virtualenv is a best-practice for protecting your OS.

	python3 -m venv env
	source env/bin/activate

For Windows,

	python3 -m venv env
	.\env\Scripts\activate


<!--
If pip install doesn't run, and you see (base), then deactivate the conda base environment:

	conda deactivate
-->

## Coding CLI setup

If you're on a new computer, start below with pyenv (python and pip) and nvm (node and npm).

Vibe code with numerous repos and submodules, like in our [webroot](../../../).

**Lock your screen without stopping terminal if you step away:**
On macOS, Command-Control-Q (⌘-⌃-Q)
On Windows, Windows Key + L

**Closeups during meetups**  
Zoom in on PC - Ctrl shift plus  
Zoom in on Mac - scroll wheel after setting a Modifier Key: 
System Settings > Accessibility > Zoom and choose Control or other.

**Prompt shortcuts**
Arrows to return to prior prompts
Ctrl C - Clear prompt

### Claude

[Claude Code CLI](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) ($20/month) - Recommended

<!-- 
Run /init to create a CLAUDE.md file with instructions for Claude.

Or /terminal-setup which also adds .claude/settings.json for key commands.
-->

## pyenv - for multiple versions of python

Install before python (and pip)
Each Python version pyenv installs comes with its own pip

Check if you have pyenv installed:

	pyenv --version

List the Python versions installed on your machine.  
If it's python 2 or older, best to upgrade your machine's OS.

	ls -l /usr/local/bin/python*


### For WindowsOS - Run PowerShell as Administrator

	Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine -Force

IMPORTANT: After these installs, you'll need to revert back to more secure settings with:

	Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Scope LocalMachine -Force


### Install on Windows (pyenv-win)

Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win/master/pyenv-win/install-pyenv-win.ps1" -OutFile "./install-pyenv-win.ps1"; &"./install-pyenv-win.ps1"


Download a python version and set it as your machine's global default:

	pyenv install 3.12.2
	pyenv global 3.12.2


### Install on MacOS

If pyenv is not installed, you can [install pyenv with homebrew](https://mac.install.guide/python/install-pyenv) or [with pip on Windows](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)


Sample of running python 3.10 for [Exiobase sankey trade data](https://github.com/ModelEarth/Mapping-global-ghg-emissions):

pyenv local 3.10  # Creates .python-version

	pyenv install 3.10  # Skip if you've already installed
	pyenv local 3.10
	python3.10 -m venv env  # Before re-running, delete the existing env folder, or skip this line and reuse the env folder.
	source env/bin/activate  # On Windows .\env\Scripts\activate
	python --version

Even in a virtual environment, "pyenv global" will update your machine.
[For OpenWebUI projects](/projects/location/setup) you can use the technique above to use Python 3.11.
Python 3.12 was not compatible with the OpenWebUI build as of Jul 22, 2024.

If you need to use a prior version of Python,  
view what's installed `pyenv virtualenvs`
Here's an alternative to `-m venv env`

	pyenv install 3.7.17
	pyenv local 3.7.17
	pyenv virtualenv 3.7.17 myenv
	pyenv activate myenv

To delete the current pyenv environment use `pyenv deactivate` since you won't have a myenv folder.


## pip

pip is installed automatically with Python (including with pyenv above)

How to stop your virtual environment and update pip.  
Once in a virtual environment, avoid appending 3 (as in pip3 or python3) .

	ctrl-c
	python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
	pip -V

<!--
To check which shell you are using:

	echo $SHELL

If your shell is zsh, open .zshrc in your home directory. Add at the end of the file:
Wasn't in there, and currently running python 3.12

	export PATH="/Users/Library/Python/3.9/bin:$PATH"

Replace with the actual path where your python pip scripts are located.

Close the current and open a new terminal window for the updated configuration.
Type `echo $PATH` to verify.
-->

## nvm for node and npm

	nvm -v

**To install nvm**  
[MacOS/Linux - curl command with bash to install nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). On a Mac since OS X 10.9, first run `touch ~/.zshrc`.  
[WindowsOS](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases) - In the .exe installer, first choose C:\Program Files\nvm, then leave syslink default as C:\nvm4w\nodejs to avoid errors from permissions and space in "Program Files". Restart your PowerShell terminal.  

Check if you already have node and npm. If so, it's easiest to AVOID installing nvm, unless you are encountering permission errors.

	node -v
	npm -v


Note: [npmjs.com](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) recommends installing the Node Version Manager [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to avoid permission errors when you run npm packages globally.  
Run `nvm ls` to see all the node versions you have installed. 

**Update nvm to set your version of node**

	nvm install 22.20.0
	nvm use 22.20.0

Run the above BEFORE invoking a virtual environment.

Note that prior to 2025 we avoided node v22 because there was a [punycode error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68774489/punycode-is-deprecated-in-npm-what-should-i-replace-it-with) in data-commons build.

**If you're not using Node Version Manager (nvm)** (above)
You can [install node/npm directly](https://nodejs.org/en/download). The installer includes the Node.js package manager (npm) within it, so you won't need to install npm separately.  

Skip this if you are using nvm (above). This directly updates your machine to the latest stable version of NodeJS.
<!-- https://askubuntu.com/questions/426750/how-can-i-update-my-nodejs-to-the-latest-version-->

	npm install -g n &&
	sudo n stable



## Python

Check python version (may differ in your virtual environments)
Only python3 was available after running `brew install python` after upgrading to Mac Sonoma OS.

	python --version
	python3 --version


If your python version is older, you may want to upgrade Python to 3.10 or 3.11.  
3.10 is needed for the Nature journal Exiobase download for Sankey.  
3.11 is currently used for the OpenWebUI build as of as of Jul 22, 2024.
3.12 does not work for the two above, use pyenv.

If you don't have brew yet, [download the .pkg installer](https://brew.sh).
You might also get a dialog to install xcode.

	brew install python




## Conda

View a list of your conda environments.
If none are found, [download from Anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com/download) - Open by clicking the Anaconda app. Reopen your terminals.

	conda env list  

A new install places at:
base * /opt/anaconda3

You can delete any unnecessary ones with `conda remove --name [ENV_NAME] --all`  

You can click your Anaconda app to upgrade, then reopen your terminals.
Or you can try using a cmd to upgrade, but you may need to download.

	conda update -n base -c defaults conda

[Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)

To open, run in the folder containing the .ipynb files you're editing.

	jupyter notebook



To always run conda when opening a terminal. You'll see (base)

	conda config --set auto_activate_base true

Turn off (base). 

	conda config --set auto_activate_base false

<!--
Neither fixes "error: externally-managed-environment"
Use a pyenv virtual environment to resolve.
-->

## Docker

[Docker Desktop download](https://www.docker.com) - Install and you'll see an whale-boat icon. Don't install Docker using Homebrew. Docker for Mac (Docker Desktop) provides better performance and integration with the operating system. 

If the docker cmd is not recognized after installing Docker on a Mac, Create a symbolic link. Then confirm with `docker --version`

	sudo ln -s /Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/bin/docker /usr/local/bin/docker

<!--
On a Mac, if the `docker` cmd is not recognized, go to your **Users\\[username]** folder and edit one of these hidden files corresponding to your command terminal instance: .zshrc, .bash_profile, .bashrc or .profile. Add the path `$HOME/.docker/bin` with these:

	export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
	export PATH="$HOME/.docker/bin:$PATH"
-->

If you're transitioning from an old instance of [Docker](https://www.docker.com), you may need to reinstall or do a Docker reboot.

<!--
	docker --version
	docker which


Removed these from end of .zshrc
First maybe from ChatGPT.

export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
export PATH="$HOME/.docker/bin:$PATH"

export PATH="$HOME/.docker/bin:$PATH"
-->


<!--
Probably not needed:

Run if your version of conda won't update on your Mac. [source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75988022/conda-wont-update-on-macos)

	brew install python &&
	conda install -n base -c defaults 'conda>=24.3.0'

For the python install, you may also need to run:

	xcode-select --install

Type "python" followed by hitting tab key to see your python versions.

Make python3.12 (or a newer version) the main version on your system:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74343871/how-do-i-fix-my-python-version-showing-up-in-terminal

	# If you already have a python sym-link or binary file there, rename it
	sudo mv /usr/local/bin/python /usr/local/bin/python-

	# create sym-link to python3.11
	sudo ln -s `which python3.12` /usr/local/bin/python

	# check the version
	python --version
-->

<!--

After running brew install python

Says 3.12, but python --version returns 3.8.5

==> No broken dependents to reinstall!
==> Caveats
==> python@3.12
Python has been installed as
  /usr/local/bin/python3

Unversioned symlinks `python`, `python-config`, `pip` etc. pointing to
`python3`, `python3-config`, `pip3` etc., respectively, have been installed into
  /usr/local/opt/python@3.12/libexec/bin

See: https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python
==> pipx
zsh completions have been installed to:
  /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions
==> postgresql@14
This formula has created a default database cluster with:
  initdb --locale=C -E UTF-8 /usr/local/var/postgresql@14
For more details, read:
  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/app-initdb.html

To start postgresql@14 now and restart at login:
  brew services start postgresql@14
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  /usr/local/opt/postgresql@14/bin/postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgresql@14
 -->

## Github CLI

### Install Chocolatey package manager

For anyone unable to install the Github CLI on their Windows PC using winget, Chocolatey works smoothly. When opening Powershell first, right click Powershell and run as Administrator then run this:

	Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
	[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072
	iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

### Install GitHub CLI via Chocolatey

	choco install gh -y
