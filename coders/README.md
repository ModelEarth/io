# Earthathon 2024
### Online with DemocracyLab
#### Saturday, April 20, 2024
### Noon to 8 PM EDT Atlanta &nbsp;(9 AM to 5 PM PDT Seattle)

Mark your calendar and join in our [Earth Day AI projects](../)

We'll use our Earthscape Chatbot UI fork to combine over 100 LLMs with Data Science visualizations. Real-time Natural language processing (NLP) processing of chats will pull locations, impact areas and UN goals for our chart output within cinematic page headers.

### Upcoming Hackathons at DevPost.com

Many hackthons have money prizes. Register the team in one you'd like to manage and spearhead our involvement! &nbsp;Check out [Devpost.com/hackathons](https://devpost.com/hackathons)

For example, the [DLT Climate Hackathon](https://dlt-climate-hackathon.devpost.com/details/dates) focuses on integration with their carbon reporting tool - so we'd need someone interested in becoming an expert and sharing with us ways to extend the DLT tool. We could intergrate with BuildingTransparency.org product [impact profiles](/io/template/).<br>
