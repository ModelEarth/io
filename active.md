Welcome! - Our next Model.earth meetup is Thursday at Noon EDT




Welcome! - Our next Model.earth meetup is Sunday at 10 PM EDT


Hi, thanks for registering with our ModelEarth team!

We meet next on Sunday at 10 PM EDT, and again on Thursday at Noon EDT.
(We also do focused meetups Mondays and Tuesdays in the afternoon.)

Let me know which of the following areas you're interested in:
Javascript, React, D3, Leaflet, Python, Forecasting with ML, LLM Chat JSON

Our meetup link is here. (It's always the same)
https://model.earth/io/coders

Here are our active projects:
https://model.earth/io

You can pull down our main repos with a single cmd after forking our three:
https://model.earth/localsite/start/steps

Let me know if you'd like a welcome letter for the OPT program.

Looking forward to working with you!

Loren Heyns

----

Here's the template for the OPT letter.
Please adjust anything to fit your needs - update the start, job title, etc.

Here's a page with our current python ML to-do's:
https://model.earth/data-pipeline/timelines/training/naics

Our LLM chat work will be taking place in this fork of Chatbot UI which will allow us to use NLP while interacting with 100+ LLM APIs! 

What's your favorite LLM currently? ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, MJ or another? I've been using chat.openai.com 3.5 a lot to create code snippets.

Go ahead and fork our Earthscape Chatbot UI instance:
https://model.earth/earthscape
https://github.com/modelearth/earthscape

And finally, let me know your area of interest in our Data Commons repo:

https://model.earth/data-commons/dist

Looking forward to Sunday, thanks for getting involved!

	[Google Places API]() - Hours of Operation, All The Places Recyclers, BuildingTransparency Manufacturers



	We need to figure out a crosswalk from the Naics6 department of labor data we pull for levels of employment, as it relates to the new 72 sectors the EPA now uses. Previously they used 389 sectors.  The sectors are a fairly close match to the naics values.

<br>Feb 2024 - from Wes Ingwersen, US EPA Engineer:

Hi State Partners,

I’m happy to share that our report, supporting figures and all the data files for v1.0 of the USEEIO State Models are now published. [View Report](https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_Report.cfm?dirEntryId=360453&Lab=CESER)

[Excel version of 2020 models](http://doi.org/10.23719/1530076) for all states:

We have files with models for all states for a given year in a native useeior Model format on a public server as well.

We have 100’s of supporting figures [including maps of the U.S.](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.7041473) showing environmental pressure intensity grouped by indicator and commodity for all states and rankings of sectors by consumption by environmental pressure for 2020.

Please review the materials and let Wes know if you have any questions.
 
[The industry comparisons](../localsite/info/) draw on our EPA data prepared and presented using useeior (R Language),  useeio.js and the [useeio-widgets](../io/charts/) (Javascript and HTML using the USEEIO-API). Let us know if you have priorities and interests there and could provide us with some interactive feedback (testing) as we put that together.

As a reminder (and mentioned in the report) we’re working on Consumption-based GHG inventories (CBEI) for Maine and other Northeast states as an application of these models but the functionalities we develop and describe will be available for all States. We anticipate that being completed by early summer.

1. Where are concentrations of electric and hydrogen vehicle parts manufacturers emerging?  

2. Where are combustion vehicle manufacturers likely to be impacted?  

3. How can we improve the visualization of supply chain inflow and outflow for local impacts on jobs, value added and the environment?
