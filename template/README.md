<h2 style="margin-top:0px;padding-top:0px;">International Impact Labels for Communities and Individuals using Environmental Product Declarations (EPD) with YAML</h2>

Environmental Impact Profiles published using JSON and the easily-readable [YMAL syntax](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html) allow scenarios and entity profiles to be easily shared and compared for communities, companies and individuals when combined with international standards created for Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) by organizations like the Smart Built Environment Innovation Program in Europe and <a href="https://buildingtransparency.org" target="_blank">Building&nbsp;Transparency</a> in the United States.

Standardized international data practices have emerged for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) interoperability based on common units of flow when measuring the activities of agents within a comparable range of time.<sup>1</sup>  Large backend databases like USEEIO<sup>2</sup>, Ecoinvent<sup>3</sup> and Bonsai<sup>4</sup> now make the output of flow analysis broadly accessible by aggregating results into small, pre-processed files output to CSV, JSON, [JSON-LD](https://www.greendelta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/LCA_XV_JSON-LD_final.pdf) or YAML for use in fast-loading, static website displays &ndash; which are increasingly hosted for free using Content Delivery Networks (CDN) in conjunction with collaborative editing sites like GitHub.

<div class="text-highlight">
Currently, most EPD reporting is still done via <a href="https://www.nrmca.org/association-resources/sustainability/epd-program/epd-ready-mix-usa-materials-lookup/">PDF</a>.<br>

An opportunity exists to improve entity data sharing by extending machine readable Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) formats to also describe community impacts and individual footprints.  Using YAML, an easy-to-read superset of JSON, entity reports can be compared visually or formatted as summaries for a variety of entities, with layouts similar to nutritional labels. (Figure 1)

An EPD file is a short version of an entity's Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) report. The LCA report can be stored privately to protect sensitive data. The EPD format allows a public-facing summary to shared without exposing company secrets.  

Storing editable scenario configuration files as YAML allows for faster editing by humans since YAML uses a simple outline format. Subsequently there are fewer opportunities for errors. YAML is also less intimidating than JSON to new editors. 

The Carbon Leadership Forum has aligned analysis methods around a common standard for conveying estimates of embodied carbon from extracting, manufacturing and installing construction materials.<sup>5</sup> 

To automate the exchange of impact files, Building Transparency has extended the popular ILCD+EPD standard<sup>6</sup> to include guarantees for the uniqueness of agents, dated version control and precise Product Category Rules (PCR).  In the [OpenEPD Interchange Format](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rvWl0W2nmCohaaHXG1P-uX5cDKHv_vD9zfTV5A6qM7A/edit#), each sector's classifications are defined independently by industry groups extending base properties.<sup>7</sup>  

The resulting classifications may be output as JSON or converted to YAML <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(a superset of JSON).</span>

**AS JSON**  

~~~
“concrete” : {
   “compressive_strength_28d” : 35.5,
   “compressive_strength_3d” : 25,
   “exposure_F” : “F0”,
}
~~~

**As YAML**

~~~
concrete:  
 compressive_strength_28d: 35.5  
 compressive_strength_3d: 25  
 exposure_F: F0
~~~





**Advantage of YAML for entity data sharing**  

JSON is well suited for data interchange since the structure is rigid, however  
YAML (based on JSON standards) has the added advantage of being slim and easier to read/edit.  

- Machine-Readable - A significant advantage over using PDF files as the sole source  
- Human-Editable - Fewer errors are likely when editing YAML compared to JSON scenario files   
- Modular for CI/CD settings - Stand-alone files are not dependant on an API for transfer   
- Equitable - Allows for static file comparisons without database access requirements
- Inclusive - Universally accessible to developers, designers and machine learning

**Enhancements to the International ILCD+EPD+ Standard provided by openEPD**

- Guarantees for the uniqueness of agents
- Dated version control
- Precise Product Category Rules (PCR)
- New sector classifications defined independently

[Plus codes](https://9to5google.com/2018/03/13/google-plus-codes-maps/), also known as Open Location Code, were developed by Google in 2015 for locations without streetnames. Plus codes represent regions using 100-meter and 14-meter squares. An additional character can be added for 3 square meter precision - like the location of a loading dock.

**Additional advantages of YAML when outputting HTML for PDF files**

- Ability to self reference 
- Support for complex datatypes 
- Embedded block literals 
- Storage of comments

**Machine Learning Applications**

Indexes of Machine-Readable APIs and detail files allow for graph analysis and imputation for missing data to further reduce uncertainties in the evaluation of local impacts.

**Conclusion**

Basing new inflow-outflow summaries for communities and individuals on existing EPD standards, developed intially for product impacts, will simplify the ease with which impacts are compared and mitigated for locations, workforces and schools. Including YAML file links in environmental product directories will allow for easier sharing of metadata for scenario configuration and web services such as impact labels and heatmaps, while providing a human-readable format that works equally well for machine learning analysis. 

A frontend YAML editing interface is being developed by Code for America<sup>8</sup> to update community impact scenario files directly using GitHub Actions. The new work extends the metadata editing interface created by the government of Italy to manage public code repositories. The same process could update individual footprint estimates using a community's unique baseline mix of industries and commute times.

Possible next steps: Set up GitHub Actions using [Futura's scenario analysis tool for LCA](https://futura.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)<sup>9</sup> to preprocess foreground model data using Wurst library Python functions and the Brightway2 framework with background database systems like Ecoinvent.
