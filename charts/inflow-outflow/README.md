[IO Charts](../)

**Volunteer Project:** Update [React in useeio-widgets](https://github.com/modelearth/useeio-widgets/) to avoid zero $0 dollar values when [a state is viewed (Maine)](#state=ME).  
The existing React code only supports the US model: [US inflow-outflow](./)

Compare with examples that work in [useeio.js javascript](/useeio.js/footprint/).
Compare [US](/useeio.js/footprint/sector_scopes.html) and [Maine](/useeio.js/footprint/sector_scopes.html#state=ME)

Another issue: The state remains in the URL in the current page, but you have to hit reload after [changing it (Georgia)](#state=GA).
